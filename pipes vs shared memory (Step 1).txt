Pipes are simple communication channels that are used for unidirectional interprocess communication. Shared memory is memory that can be simultaneously accessed by multiple programs in order to provide communication between them. In other words, pipes are sort of like passing messages between two people while shared memory is like publishing information. I would choose shared memory because while it's harder to debug, it allows communication to more people/programs simultaneously.
